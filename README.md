# Rage-of-Chinchilla-Game

This is my CS50 final project (Dec-2022): A shooting game named The Rage of Chinchilla

The Game is based on the Pygame module on Python
The player controls Smile the Chinchilla and uses his plasma gun against 2 kinds of enemies - Antonio and Joker
Antonio is a close quarter fighter
Joker is a long ranger shooter
While fighting in the arena, the player can take coca cola to restore health
The game has a scoring system tracking the number of kills

Reference:
The Chinchilla characters are from SMILE, a popular Wechat emoji in China
The weapon is from the game Halo. It is used by the Sangheili species
